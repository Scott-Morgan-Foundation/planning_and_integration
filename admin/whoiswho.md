# Foundation Systems Project Directory 

The Foundations Systems Project has many named roles, which reflects the required complex integration of multiple systems. Named roles may also lead a larger team of contributors and collaborators . All roles are important to the realization of the 12 Scott-Morgan Foundation Missions; however, roles in bold are code critical roles and "minimum viable product" (MVP) for the near-term Foundation Systems Project goals.
