# Foundation Missions

The roles of the Foundation Systems Project support the 12 Missions of The Scott-Morgan Foundation. While all members of the Foundation are committed to the 12 Missions, some roles support only one mission, while other roles support many. These project roles are mapped to the missions they most directly support.
