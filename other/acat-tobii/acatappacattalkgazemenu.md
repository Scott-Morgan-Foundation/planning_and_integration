# Using ACAT App and ACAT Talk Gaze to create a Usable Menu System

Peter has primarily been using the ACAT software to provide communication (text-to-speech) functionality and as such has his laptop
set up to simply start the **ACATTalkGaze** application.

The full **ACAT** solution is more capable than this.  As well as the **ACATTalkGaze** application Intel have created a primary **ACATApp** application

The ACATApp application is designed to feed selections (triggered by TOBII) through to an Active Windows Application and thus it is capable
of driving Microsoft Office and other applications so that Peter could if he so wished, drive the appropriate application functionality
(such as _Write a Document_ or _Send an Email_)

To enable this functionality the **ACATApp** must be started first and from within the app there is a Speech button which starts up **ACATTalkGaze**
